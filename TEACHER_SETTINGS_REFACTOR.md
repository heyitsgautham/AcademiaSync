# Teacher Settings Page - Refactoring Summary

## Date: 3 October 2025

### Changes Made

#### ✅ Frontend Component (`teacher-settings-sections.tsx`)

**Removed (Out of Scope):**
- ❌ Profile picture upload functionality
- ❌ Phone number field
- ❌ Bio field
- ❌ All notification preferences (Email Notifications, Assignment Reminders, Student Messages, Weekly Reports)
- ❌ Account settings section (Change Password, 2FA, Delete Account)

**Updated to Match Database Schema:**
- ✅ Split "Full Name" into `first_name` and `last_name` fields
- ✅ Made email field read-only (comes from Google OAuth)
- ✅ Added `age` field (number input, 18-100 validation)
- ✅ Added `specialization` field (text input for teachers)

**Backend Integration Added:**
- ✅ React Query (`useQuery`) for fetching teacher profile
- ✅ React Query (`useMutation`) for updating profile
- ✅ Loading states with spinner
- ✅ Form validation (required fields, age range)
- ✅ Success/error toasts for user feedback
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Session-based authentication

#### ✅ Backend API Routes

**Created `/api/teacher/profile/route.ts` (Next.js API route):**
- GET: Fetches authenticated user's profile from user-service
- PUT: Updates user profile with validation
- Uses NextAuth session for authentication
- Extracts JWT from session and forwards to backend

**Created `/backend/user-service/src/routes/users.js`:**
- GET `/api/users/profile`: Returns user profile (id, email, role, first_name, last_name, age, specialization)
- PUT `/api/users/profile`: Updates user profile with validation
- Both endpoints require authentication middleware
- Registered route in user-service index.js

### Database Schema Alignment

The refactored component now matches the `users` table schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    google_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,  -- ✅ Added
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,   -- ✅ Added
    age INTEGER,                        -- ✅ Added
    specialization VARCHAR(255),        -- ✅ Added (for teachers)
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Form Fields

**Profile Information Card:**
1. **First Name*** (required, editable)
2. **Last Name*** (required, editable)
3. **Email** (read-only, from Google OAuth)
4. **Age** (optional, number 18-100)
5. **Specialization** (optional, text field)

### Validation Rules

- First name and last name are required
- Age must be between 18 and 100 (if provided)
- Email cannot be changed (linked to Google account)
- All changes trigger backend validation

### User Experience Improvements

- Loading spinner during data fetch
- Loading button state during save
- Success toast on successful update
- Error toast with descriptive messages
- Disabled save button during submission
- Form pre-populated with existing data

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] User can view their profile information
- [ ] User can update first name
- [ ] User can update last name
- [ ] User can update age (optional)
- [ ] User can update specialization (optional)
- [ ] Email field is read-only
- [ ] Validation errors show for empty required fields
- [ ] Validation errors show for age out of range
- [ ] Success toast appears on successful save
- [ ] Error toast appears on failed save
- [ ] Profile data persists after page refresh
- [ ] Changes are reflected immediately after save

### API Endpoints

**Frontend → Backend Flow:**

```
Frontend Component
    ↓ (React Query)
Next.js API Route (/api/teacher/profile)
    ↓ (JWT from NextAuth session)
User Service (/api/users/profile)
    ↓ (Database query)
PostgreSQL (users table)
```

### Security

- Authentication required for all profile operations
- JWT validation on every request
- Role-based access (teacher role required)
- Input validation on both frontend and backend
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries

### Future Enhancements (Out of Current Scope)

- Profile picture upload with storage solution
- Phone number field (requires database migration)
- Bio/description field (requires database migration)
- Notification preferences (requires new table)
- Password change (handled by Google OAuth)
- Two-factor authentication
- Account deletion workflow
