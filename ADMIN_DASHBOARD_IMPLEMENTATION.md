## 🚀 Next Steps

### Backend Implementation Required:
1. Create API routes in `backend/user-service/src/routes/admin.js` for:
   - Stats, Analytics, Profile
   - Teacher CRUD operations
   - Student listing and role promotion

2. Add middleware to verify admin role for these routes

3. Database queries needed:
   - Count teachers, students, courses
   - Calculate average grade across all submissions
   - Get students per teacher (with JOIN)
   - Update user roles (Student → Teacher/Admin)
   - Add specialization field when promoting to Teacher

### Database Schema Note:
The current schema supports everything except you may want to verify:
- `users.specialization` field exists (it does!)
- Role can be updated to "Admin" or "Teacher"
- No foreign key constraints preventing role changes

---

## 🎨 Design Consistency

The admin dashboard follows the exact same layout and architecture as:
- **Teacher Dashboard** (green theme)
- **Student Dashboard** (blue theme)

This ensures:
- Consistent user experience across roles
- Easy maintenance
- Familiar navigation patterns
- Code reusability

---

## ✨ Special Features

1. **Role Promotion with Validation**
   - Admin → Student promotion requires specialization
   - Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental changes
   - Updates reflected immediately after successful promotion

2. **Smart Table Filtering**
   - Real-time search across multiple fields
   - Specialization dropdown filter for teachers
   - Shows result count

3. **Theme-Aware Charts**
   - Charts adapt to light/dark mode
   - Uses CSS variables for colors
   - Custom X-axis tick component for long labels

4. **Form Validation**
   - Required field indicators (*)
   - Email format validation
   - Password strength requirements (6+ chars)
   - Age range validation (18-100)

---

## 📊 Statistics Dashboard

The admin dashboard provides at-a-glance metrics:
- Total Teachers (with icon)
- Total Students (with icon)  
- Total Courses (with icon)
- Average Grade system-wide (with icon)

All stat cards are visually consistent with red theming.
